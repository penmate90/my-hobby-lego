                My hobby is building legos. Legos are building blocks from which you can make anything you want. Whenever i feel boed or have a good idea to build something, itry to build it! The Legos realese mt stress and make me happy! So thats why I like lego.<br> <br>
                The company's flagship product, Lego, consists of variously coloured interlocking plastic bricks accompanying an array of gears, figurines called minifigures, and various other parts. Lego pieces can be assembled and connected in many ways to construct objects, including vehicles, buildings, and working robots.
